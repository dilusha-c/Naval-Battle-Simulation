⚓ Advanced Naval Battle Simulation System
📌 Project Overview

The Advanced Naval Battle Simulation System is a C based simulation that models a naval combat scenario involving a battleship and multiple escort ships. The system calculates ship positions, firing ranges, hit probabilities, and battle outcomes using mathematical and logical rules. A two dimensional grid is used to visualize the battlefield and ship movements.

This project was developed as part of the SE1012 Programming Module.

📥 Input Description

The simulation reads data from data.dat, which includes:

🔢 Number of escort ships

🚢 Escort ship details:

ID and type (A, B, C, D, E)

Position coordinates (x, y)

Impact power

Time between two firings

Shooting angle range

Shell velocity range

Minimum and maximum range

Gamma value

⚓ Battleship details:

Type

Starting position

Travel points

Shell velocity range

Maximum firing range

Gamma value

📤 Output Description

The program outputs:

🗺️ A two dimensional battlefield grid

➰ Battleship movement path

⚠️ Gun jamming events

🎯 Updated attacking angles

💥 Number of escort ships hit

⏱️ Battle duration

❤️ Battleship remaining health or sinking status

📜 Order of escort ships attacked

🗺️ 2D Battlefield Grid Representation

The battlefield is represented using a two dimensional grid to provide a clear spatial view of ship positions and movement.

Symbols Used
Symbol	Meaning
A, B, C, D, E	Escort ship types
#	Battleship starting position
*	Battleship travel point
-	Empty sea cell

This grid helps in understanding engagement zones, validating distance calculations, and visually tracking the progress of the battle.

▶️ How to Compile and Run
🔧 Compile
gcc main.c -o naval_simulation -lm

▶️ Run
./naval_simulation


Ensure data.dat is in the same directory as main.c.

📊 Sample Results Summary

✔️ Escort ships hit range from 11 to 18 depending on scenario

✔️ Battle duration varies based on escort ship density

✔️ Gun jamming directly affects battleship attack capability

✔️ Battleship may survive or sink based on damage received

🚀 Future Improvements

🎨 Graphical user interface

🔄 Dynamic ship movement

🎯 Advanced probability based damage modeling

🚢 Multiple battleship coordination

⏱️ Real time simulation visualization
